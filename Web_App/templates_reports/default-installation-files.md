Default installation files on xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx



Hi,


One of your server `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` serves default Apache files.


## PoC

https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/
{}


## Risk

While this does not represent a real security issue, it's always a good practice to remove default installation files.
Certain files could reveal important informations about your system and could be used by a malicious user for a future attack.


## Remediation

Disable or remove default installation files on production servers.
