Source code disclosure on xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx



Hi,

I found some urls that reveal informations about your system. A malicious user could use some of them to conduct an attack in the future.


## PoC

http://xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx


## Remediation

Configure the web server to not serve that kind of files.
